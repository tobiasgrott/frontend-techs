            If you're wondering why this site is so basic, that's because it's only
            just beginning. It's an experiment. An Adventure. A classroom and a
            playground all rolled into a single repository
        </p>
        <p>
            One day, this site will not only be fully functional, you will be able to
            render it using three different frameworks (or specific lack thereof), and 
            three different design systems:
            <ul>
                <li>React + Material UI</li>
                <li>Angular + Clarity</li>
                <li>Vanilla JS + Carbon</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            But first, it must grow from the very basics. It started with a single
            HTML template, and a single Javacript file. You can read more about that
